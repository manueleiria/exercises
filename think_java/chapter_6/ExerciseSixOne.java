//Exercise 6.1
/*1. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU INVOKE A VALUE METHOD AND DON'T DO ANYTHING WITH
THE RESULT; THAT IS, IF YOU DON'T ASSIGN IT TO A VARIABLE OR USE IT AS PART OF A LARGER EXPRESSION?

The program compiles but it doesn't return anything, it just runs the method and immediatly discards the result.

2. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU USE A VOID METHOD AS PART OF AN EXPRESSION? FOR
EXAMPLE, TRY System.out.println("boo!") + 7;

"System.out.println("boo!") + 7;" is not a statement.*/
